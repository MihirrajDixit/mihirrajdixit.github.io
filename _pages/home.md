#### **About me**

I am an ardent researcher with a general inclination toward solving intricate problems in STEM subjects. By education, I am an electronics and computer engineer actively exploring systems and security. I have had more than four years of work experience, with interactions in various multidisciplinary domains ranging from industrial control systems and wireless & telecom systems to computing technologies. I am currently studying cybersecurity in the department of informatics at Universität des Saarlandes, Germany.

Previously, I completed my undergrad with a degree in electronics and telecommunication at VJTI, Mumbai. During this period, I was involved in research with Prof. Dr. Faruk Kazi for more than two years in the field of cyber-physical systems. Later, I had an opportunity to work in Rakuten Symphony, Japan, in 4G/5G-based cloud projects for another two years. My job roles were not just limited to Software Development Engineer, but I could also see myself exploring as a Cloud Engineer, SRE, DevOps, Product Owner, etc.  

Besides my academic background, I find myself exploring the bits and pieces of the world during my free time. I love to play chess, trek across mountains, visit multiple places, and know their culture and history. My active hobbies lie in anthropology, linguistics, and political science.

#### **Research Interests**

Broadly, my research interest lies in Telecommunication, Distributed Systems, and Cybersecurity, with the key areas of focus in cellular technologies like 5G/6G, physical layer security, and cryptography. Apart from that, I am interested in exploring complex logic and algorithms that can exercise the brain actively. In addition, I like to find solutions to real-life problems to create a better and easier future for humanity.
