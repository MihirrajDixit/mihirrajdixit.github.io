#### **About me**

I am an ardent researcher with a general inclination toward solving intricate problems in STEM subjects. By education, I am an electronics and computer engineer actively exploring systems and security. I have had more than four years of work experience, with interactions in various multidisciplinary domains ranging from industrial control systems and wireless & telecom systems to computing technologies. I am currently studying cybersecurity in the department of informatics at [Universität des Saarlandes, Germany](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html).

Previously, I completed my undergrad with a degree in electronics and telecommunication at [VJTI, Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veermata_Jijabai_Technological_Institute). During this period, I was involved in research with [Prof. Dr. Faruk Kazi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=oa7QCAgAAAAJ&hl=en) for more than two years in the field of cyber-physical systems. Later, I had an opportunity to work in [Rakuten Symphony, Japan](https://symphony.rakuten.com/), in 4G/5G-based cloud projects for another two years. My key responsibilities were not just limited to Software Development, but I could also see myself exploring as a Cloud Engineer, SRE, DevOps, Product Owner, etc.  

Besides my academic background, I find myself delving into bits and pieces of the world during my free time. I love to play chess, trek across mountains, visit multiple places, and learn about their culture and history. Some of my hobbies include anthropology, linguistics, and political science.

You can find more information about me [here]({{ 'assets/pdf/cv.pdf' | relative_url }}) and in various sections of this website.

#### **Research Interests**

Broadly, my research interests lie in Telecommunications, Distributed, Networked & Mobile Systems, and Cybersecurity, with the key areas of focus being physical layer security, system protocols and cryptography. Apart from that, I am interested in complex logics and algorithms that can actively exercise the brain. In addition, I like to find solutions to real-life problems to create a better and easier future for humanity.
